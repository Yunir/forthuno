# Forthuno

 The Forth dialect with Indirect Threaded Code (ITC) to dive into practice.

## Quick start

Build the docker image

```shell
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t forthuno .
```

Run the docker container with a mounted directory to get the results

```shell
docker run --rm forthuno
```

## How to use

There are some tests to understand how this dialect works.
Use Make instructions to comprehend the idea of each Forth word:

```
$ make test1
$ make test2
...
$ make test7
$ make test8
$ make stdlib
```

## 2 modes

1. Interpretation mode
2. Compilation mode

## Project structure

* **forthuno.asm** - implemented interpreter and compiler
* **dict.inc** - dictionary of forth words
* **util.inc** - some definitions and assembly functions to interact with the dictionary
* **macro.inc** - macros to ease programming and understanding the code
* **io_lib.inc** - assembly functions to deal with io
